* Utilized PyPDF2 for extracting and preprocessing text from PDFs, ensuring seamless integration with AI-driven workflows.
* Leveraged Google AI APIs (e.g., NLP and PaLM) to enhance text processing, key concept extraction, and question generation accuracy.
* Built an intuitive Streamlit interface allowing users to upload PDFs, customize difficulty levels, and generates specific number of MCQs.
